Case study made for Advanced Field Solution .Net Developer job application.

There are some features missing from this code.
Such as unit testings, fiktering based on date. And also I tried to do pagination but I couldn't get it to work with the sorting and filtering.

And also as a beginner, I don't know much about software architecture.

Other than all of this, It was a great experience to make this program. And I looking forward to hear your feedback.
